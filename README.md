# Tic_Tac_Toe

https://github.com/rahul128154/Tic_Tac_Toe.git

This game implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game with two modes: Computer vs Player and Player vs Player. Here's a breakdown of its key points:

1. Introduction**: The code begins by including necessary libraries and defining a class `Tic_Tac_Toe`. It also declares various member functions for displaying the board, getting player choices, checking for a winner, and managing different game modes.

2. Implementation Details:
   - The `show_board` function displays the current state of the game board.
   - `get_x_player_choice` and `get_o_player_choice` allow players to make their moves.
   - `get_computer_choice` generates a random move for the computer player.
   - `check_winner` determines if there's a winner or if the game is a draw.
   - Two main game modes are implemented: `computer_vs_player` and `player_vs_player`.

3. Game Modes:
   - In `computer_vs_player`, the player competes against the computer.
   - In `player_vs_player`, two human players compete against each other.

4. Conclusion**: After selecting a game mode, the program runs the game until there's a winner or a draw. It then displays the final state of the game board and waits for user input before closing.

Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of Tic Tac Toe, allowing players to enjoy the game either against a computer opponent or against each other.
